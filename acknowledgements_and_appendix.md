## Appendix
There are a variety of references to Google products in this document. To provide more context,
I give a short description of the most common examples below.

YouTube is a streaming video service. Both YouTube Watch Next and YouTube Home Page
teams use ML models to rank video recommendations. Watch Next recommends videos to
watch after the currently playing one, while Home Page recommends videos to users browsing
the home page.
#### Google Play Overview
Google Play has many models solving a variety of problems. Play Search, Play Home Page
Personalized Recommendations, and ‘Users Also Installed’ apps all use machine learning.
##### Google Plus Overview
Google Plus uses machine learning in a variety of situations: ranking posts in the “stream” of
posts being seen by the user, ranking “What’s Hot” posts (posts that are very popular now),
ranking people you know, et cetera.
